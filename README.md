### How to contribute to the translations

First, you need an account here on GitHub.com. Go make one if you have not already!

Got an account? Next up, you need to fork this repository by clicking the Fork button up in the top right corner. This will take you to a new page after it's finished, and the URL will be something like `https://github.com/YourUsername/Pixelmon-Language`. Save that webpage, because you will probably want to go there a lot.

Now you're all set to start translating! Here's how you do it. First you need to find the language you are adding to, for this example we will look at French, but obviously this will be different depending on the language you are translating the mod for. Find the .lang file for the language on your fork's main page.

Once you're there, you will see a very long text file. To edit it, click the little pencil on the right.

From here you will go to each lang key (the text to the left of the =) and translate the text on the right of the =. It is very important you do not change what's on the left-side of the equals sign. For example, `item.Ranch Block.name=Ranch Block` will always be `item.Ranch Block.name=[something]`. 

When you are finished with your changes, down the bottom you enter a title for what you have changed, and optionally a description. Then make sure you have `Commit directly to the master branch` ticked, then press `Commit changes`.
